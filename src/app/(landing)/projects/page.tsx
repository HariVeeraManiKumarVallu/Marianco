        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
        <p>
          We approach our mission with a three-pronged strategy: prevention,
          rescue, and rehabilitation. Through community education and awareness
          programs, we work to prevent exploitation before it happens. For those
          who have already been victimized, our rescue missions, legal support,
          and safe homes provide immediate aid. Lastly, we offer long-term
          rehabilitation services, including emotional and psychological care,
          education, and empowerment programs to help children reclaim their
          futures.
