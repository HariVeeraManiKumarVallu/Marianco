        <h1>Be a Hero for Vulnerable Children</h1>
        <p>
          Your generosity makes it possible for us to rescue and protect
          children who are at risk or have been affected by exploitation. Every
          dollar you give helps us provide safe homes, education, psychological
          support, and the means for children to start anew.
