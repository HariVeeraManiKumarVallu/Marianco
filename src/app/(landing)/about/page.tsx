        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Marianco is a non-profit organization founded by Francisco Padilla, a
          former street orphan from Cartagena, Colombia. His biological mother,
          Maria, was a child prostitute living in the Cartagena slums.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are dedicated to combating child trafficking, child prostitution,
          and child pornography. We care for all children and provide even extra
          careful support for children under the age of 15.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a deep personal connection to our mission, we strive to provide
          safety, support, and hope to children in need.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Marianco team is on a mission to eradicate the sexual exploitation
          of young children. Our organization was founded by individuals who
          could not stand by while children across the world continued to suffer
          from the horrors of trafficking, exploitation, and abuse.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through targeted interventions, powerful advocacy, and hands-on
          support, Marianco seeks to protect the most vulnerable children,
          ensuring they have a safe space to grow, thrive, and reclaim their
          lives.

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
        <p>
          We approach our mission with a three-pronged strategy: prevention,
          rescue, and rehabilitation. Through community education and awareness
          programs, we work to prevent exploitation before it happens. For those
          who have already been victimized, our rescue missions, legal support,
          and safe homes provide immediate aid. Lastly, we offer long-term
          rehabilitation services, including emotional and psychological care,
          education, and empowerment programs to help children reclaim their
          futures.
